Today I learned that debugging an initContainer can be difficult, since it's hard to see what's happening inside the container while it's running.
To help with this, you can force the initContainer to sleep, which will let you shell in and take a look around.

Just append this to your command: 
`
sleep 15m ; 
`

Now your initContainer will patiently wait 15 minutes for you to get a shell, look around, and figure out what the problem is. For reference, the shell command is 

`
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c <init-container-name> /bin/bash
`
