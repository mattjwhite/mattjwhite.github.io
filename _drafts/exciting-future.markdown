A few years back I flirted with the idea of developing for iOS. The industry seemed inexorably pulled in that direction, and so I took some time to learn mobile development, preferring iOS over Android because of the usual "easier monetization/less fragmentation" refrain. 

I was lucky enough that my employer at the time sent me to a Mac/iOS development conference. During lunch they offered attendees the chance to demo apps they had built, and one in particular has stuck with me. It was an app built for a natural gas generator manufacturer. 

With this app the sales staff could visit a home, determine exactly how much generation the customer needed and the best installation spot, and record everything in the app, even the customer's signature on the installation agreement. And then the installation crew, with the same app, would have a complete parts list and scheduled installation window on their calendar. 

With this app and an iPad, the customer had a fully cohesive platform for their entire mobile workforce. It was exactly the sort of business need the iPad seemed best suited to meet.
