Hello, I'm Matt. I'm a writer and programmer. In my day job I do software development for a large company in the energy industry. I'm also the author of a book on writing web apps with Ember, out in beta now from the Pragmatic Bookshelf: [{{site.ember2_book}}]({{site.ember2_book_link}}) 

When I'm not programming or writing, I'm spending time with my family and our dogs.
