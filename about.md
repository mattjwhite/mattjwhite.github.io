Hello, I'm Matt. I'm a writer and programmer. By day, I develop software for a large company. By night, I'm a writer. I'm the author of a book on writing web apps with Ember, out now from the Pragmatic Bookshelf: [{{site.ember2_book}}]({{site.ember2_book_link}}) 

When I'm not programming or writing, I spend time with my family and our dogs.
