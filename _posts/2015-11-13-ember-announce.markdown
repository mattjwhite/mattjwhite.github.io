Sometimes good things come in bunches. Last month, I had two major life events in the same week. First, a new member joined our family. And then, [Deliver Audacious Web Apps with Ember 2](https://pragprog.com/book/mwjsember/deliver-audacious-web-apps-with-ember-2) was released in print a few days later. So I've been a little busy, but I wanted to share a few links to where you can find the book. Better late than never, right?

I'm very proud of this book. I set out to write a brief, snappy introduction to the Ember world, and I'm happy with the results. If you take a look, you'll learn about the fundamental building blocks of the core Ember framework, along with Ember Data and Ember CLI. There's also a number of sidebars that introduce a few of the excellent Addons that make up the Ember ecosystem.

It's available direct from the publisher, The Pragmatic Bookshelf, at the link above. It's also [available](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B017V69FB0/) on the Kindle, and in paperback at a number of other places. And if you have a Safari account, it's [there too](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/deliver-audacious-web/9781680501599/).

The Pragmatic site has a chapter list and a few excerpts, and I also gave a [talk](https://vimeo.com/144684394) to the Global Ember Meetup a few weeks back that acts as a good summary of what to expect from the book. Thanks again to [@EmberSherpa](http://twitter.com/embersherpa) for asking me to present!

I hope you'll think about picking up the book, and consider leaving a review of it on Amazon. Thank you!
